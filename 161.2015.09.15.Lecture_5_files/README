These are the C source files that were written or modified during
Lecture 5 on September 15, 2015.

The file 161.2015.09.15.Lecture_5.html is a copy of the slides.

The hello directory has a small test program that shows how to get the
number of elements in a static array using sizeof.

The cs161-proj1 directory is based on the source code for project 1. The
main.c file is modified to add "encode" and "decode" subcommands. You
don't need these subcommands to complete the project. They are just an
example of adding functionality to a program.
